# CI/CD Pipeline for Amazon ECS with GitHub Actions

[![AWS Thumbnail Service Actions Status](https://github.com/sys-2077/aws-thumbnail-service-1/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sys-2077/aws-thumbnail-service-1/actions)


This repository contains a sample CI/CD pipeline for deploying a containerized application to Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) using GitHub Actions. The pipeline automates the build and deployment process for your application, making it easy to manage and release new versions.

## Overview

The CI/CD pipeline consists of the following components:

- GitHub Actions: Workflow automation for building and deploying the application.
- Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR): Container image storage.
- Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS): Container orchestration and deployment.

## Getting Started

To set up the CI/CD pipeline for your own application, follow these steps:

1. **Repository Setup**:
   - Clone this repository to your local machine.
   - Replace the sample application code with your own code.

2. **AWS Setup**:
   - Create an ECR repository to store your container images.
   - Set up an ECS cluster where your containers will be deployed.

3. **GitHub Actions**:
   - Create a GitHub Actions workflow in your repository (see `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`).
   - Configure the workflow to build, tag, and push your container images to ECR.

4. **Update CloudFormation Template**:
   - Modify the CloudFormation template to define your ECS task definitions, services, and other resources.

5. **Secrets and Environment Variables**:
   - Set up secrets and environment variables in GitHub Actions to store sensitive information, such as AWS credentials.

6. **Push to Repository**:
   - Push your changes to the GitHub repository. The CI/CD pipeline will automatically trigger when new code is pushed.

## Workflow Details

The GitHub Actions workflow is defined in the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file. It includes the following stages:

1. **Build and Push Image**: This stage builds a Docker image from your code, tags it, and pushes it to your ECR repository.

2. **Deploy to ECS**: This stage uses CloudFormation to deploy a new task definition and service on your ECS cluster, using the updated image from ECR.

3. **Testing and Validation**: You can add additional steps here, such as testing your application or running quality checks.

4. **Success**: If all the previous stages complete successfully, the workflow is considered successful.

## Monitoring and Logs

You can monitor the progress of your CI/CD pipeline through the GitHub Actions interface. Additionally, you can access ECS logs and CloudWatch logs for troubleshooting and debugging.
